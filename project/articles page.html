        <h1>Cardinals lose 3-1 to the dodgers</h1>
        <p>
            The Cardinals lost in the NL wild card game on Wednesday night against the dodgers 3-1. This was a bittersweet end to a up and down season. Adam Wainwright pitched a great game against a tough dodgers lineup. The Cardinals offense did not show up to dodgers stadium. 1 run (scored on a wild pitch) was all the cardinals could put up tonight. They had several opportunities with RISP, but they couldn’t capitalize. Many cardinals’ fans are upset with manager Mike Shildt’s decision to go to struggling reliever Alex Reyes in the 9th inning. After starting off the season strong with an all-star appearance, Reyes struggled and arguably was the worst reliever on our team in the second half. I personally think there was no reason to go to Reyes there, especially with a rested pen. I probably would’ve gone to rookie Kodi Whitley who had a scoreless streak entering the game. Although losing the game was tough, I’m looking forward to seeing the future of this team. Tyler O’Neill has become arguably the best left fielder in baseball and Paul Goldschmidt had a MVP caliber season. I think the core of this team is set for years to come and if we acquire some pitching in the offseason, we could be a deadly team going into 2022.

        <h1>Cardinals Offseason Plans</h1>
        <p>
            Going into the offseason, the Cardinals had team options for Matt Carpenter and Carlos Martinez, but they elected not to pick them up. Instead, they gave a $2 million buyout to Carpenter and a $500,000 buyout to Martinez to make them both free agents. With both deep-rooted Cardinals making their way to free agency, that clears up $29 million off the table for 2022.
            For non-tender candidates, most of which were not significant in the early and late runs for the 2020-2021 Cardinals season include Jose Rondon, Max Moroff, and Justin Williams. Austin Dean, who was also a candidate, was picked up by the Giants earlier this week. The Cardinals will have until Dec. 2 to make any non-tender conclusions.
            As for the 40 man roster, there are notable prospects that could be protected from the Rule 5 Draft scheduled for sometime in December 2021. Those prospects include Nick Plummer (No. 10 Prospect), Delvin Perez (No. 13), Luken Baker (No. 14), Kramer Robertson, Brendan Donovan (No. 18), Griffin Roberts, and Julio E. Rodriguez (No. 21). Donovan and Plummer are your best bets to being added to the 40 man roster, who were both on the taxi squad for the postseason. Baker and Perez will be your spotlight watch cases. 
            The Cardinals are an interesting case going into the 2021 offseason. The biggest question is whether they will attack for a star shortstop such as Carlos Correa, Corey Seager, or Trevor Story, or will they go for starting pitcher candidates Max Scherzer, Carlos Rondon, Eduardo Rodriguez. The Cardinals need a dominant lefty to strengthen the rotation, hinting at Carlos Rondon or Eduardo Rodriguez.
