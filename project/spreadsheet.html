    <h1>Kareemâ€™s Updated Top Prospect list</h1>
    <p>
        Here is a spreadsheet of my top prospects in the St. Louis Cardinals minor league system. Overall, I think this minor league system is in the worst shape its been in years. The lack of pitching in this farm system really scares me. This system is probably somewhere around 20-25 in the MLB in my eyes.
